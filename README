PROJET EPITECH

    Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of
player scores.
    To be able to deal with the elements of your gaming plateform at run-time, your graphics libraries and your games
must be implemented as dynamic libraries, loaded at runtime.
    Each GUI available for the program must be used as a shared
library that will be loaded and used dynamically by the main
program.

Usage

```
./arcade ./lib/arcade_ncurses.so
```
